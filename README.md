A Bunto plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Bunto sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Bunto and filesystem operations, and a Javascript-based front end, built on that API.

## Installation

Refer to the [installing plugins](https://buntowaf.tk/docs/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) section of Bunto's documentation and install the `bunto-admin` plugin as you would any other plugin. Here's the short version:

1. Add the following to your site's Gemfile:

    ```ruby
    gem 'bunto-admin', group: :bunto_plugins
    ```

2. Run `bundle install`

## Usage

1. Start Bunto as you would normally (`bundle exec bunto serve`)
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/admin` to access the administrative interface

## Options

Bunto Admin related options can be specified in `_config.yml`
under a key called `bunto_admin`. Currently it has only one option `hidden_links`
which is for hiding unwanted links on the sidebar. The following keys under `hidden_links` can be used in order to hide default links;

```yaml
bunto_admin:
  hidden_links:
    - posts
    - pages
    - staticfiles
    - datafiles
    - configuration
```
